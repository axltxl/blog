<p>As part of the big changes that are coming for the 0.2 release, I needed in special to implement this one. In order to bring assurance to the code to make it even more portable, I considered necessary to put all integers on a leash because of the "liberties" they have across compilers and operating systems.<br />
<code>/* Integer types */<br />
typedef int64_t q_int64_t;<br />
typedef int32_t q_int32_t;<br />
typedef int16_t q_int16_t;<br />
typedef int8_t q_int8_t;</code></p>
<p><code>typedef uint64_t q_uint64_t;<br />
typedef uint32_t q_uint32_t;<br />
typedef uint16_t q_uint16_t;<br />
typedef uint8_t q_uint8_t;<br />
</code><br />
It switches between various implementations of malloc/realloc/calloc/free Use it at your own risk as it is highly experimental, current optional memory allocators are the following:</p>
<p>stdc - Use the Standard C Library implementation<br />
dlmalloc - Doug Lea's Malloc<br />
jemalloc - Jason Evans' Malloc</p>
